# LazyMovies

LazyMovies simple application just to test out omdbapi, you can search for any movie, check out its posters and see the release year (for now these are the only features but I plan on adding some more). The app for now has a simple design and uses riverpod to keep everything running smoothly.

Available features right now:
- Search
- Details about any movie available (including imdb Rating, release year, title, poster and actors)
